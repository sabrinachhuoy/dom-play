       <p>Here you will find links to projects that  I've worked on.</p>
       
       <p>My name is Sabrina and I  am currently a student studying software development with a program called Year  Up. </p>
       
       <p>Growing up my family was pretty strict so I stayed home quite a bit. I always played games on our computer and used social media to stay in contact with my friends. Because of being sheltered I also didn't get to explore my hobbies and personal skills and now as a young adult my biggest goal is to try as many things as possible which brings me to the program</p>
       
       <p>What I think I'll enjoy the most about learning how to program is the design aspect. There was 2 social media websites that helped me discover this: Myspace and Tumblr. I remember how much fun it was for me to find ways to make my page unique. Its safe to say that  has not changed. </p>
           
      <p>Fast forward to high school, I knew I didn't want to attend college. As stated  before I did not get to explore hobbies or talents and this carried on during high school and a few years after I  graduated. I graduated in 2016 and have been working until I was accepted into the program.  </p>

      <p>My first job was at Starbucks and I am grateful to have had this job first to set the tone for my future careers. This job taught me to believe in my skills and to not feel discouraged when  I am not good at something. Something else that I learned was to not let anyone walk all over me because they are  older.  </p>
       
      <p>My most recent job is with a company called Cambia Health Solutions where I worked as a Claims Analyst. This job taught me to pay attention to detail and pick up time management/organizational skills. I was hired during covid so I was pretty much remote my entire career here.</p>
      
      <p>I have 3 friends that have done the program and they mentioned how great Year Up is and how I should apply. At first I was hesitant because I haven't heard of the program before. What drew me to apply is Year Up's mission; "To  close the opportunity divide by ensuring that young adults gain the skills, experiences, and support that will empower them to reach their potential through careers and higher education"

      
      I resonate with this mission because I want to be apart of the movement to close the opportunity divide. For the 6 years that I worked I really felt like there was no  spot for me but there's a spot for everyone to gain these skills.  I want to see more diverse groups of people because we too are intelligent and Year Up gives us a chance to build on that.</p>
